- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` entry with the final commit hash after merge.

## Backlog: theschoonover.net Enhancements

### 1. High-Confidence Metrics (The "Business Layer")
**Goal:** Translate technical feats into ROI and risk reduction for C-suite readers.
- [ ] **Add "Impact" Bullets:** For each case study (especially "SIEM at Planetary Scale"), add a bolded impact statement (e.g., "Reduced ingestion costs by X% while increasing detection coverage for Y high-risk threat actors.").
- [ ] **Quantify Efficiency:** Mention the 99% reduction in onboarding time explicitly in the headline or summary of your Multi-SIEM migration case study.
- [ ] **Link Performance to Outcomes:** Tie your "Sub-second insights" to operational metrics like MTTR (Mean Time to Respond) or Analyst Burnout reduction.

### 2. Leadership & Culture Visibility
**Goal:** Prove you can build high-performing teams, not just high-performing pipelines.
- [ ] **Create a "Leadership Philosophy" Section:** Write a short (3–5 paragraph) piece on your approach to mentorship, hiring, and fostering a "security-as-code" culture.
- [ ] **Define the "Schoonover Standard":** Elaborate on your "Mentorship that eliminates single points of failure" bullet point. How do you actually achieve this? (e.g., specific peer review standards, lab-based training).

### 3. Patent & Intellectual Property Deep-Dives
**Goal:** Solidify your "Expert" status by making your proprietary work accessible.
- [ ] **Create Dedicated Patent Pages:** Instead of just "Patent Pending," give each a dedicated landing page or detailed section.
    *   Structure: Problem Statement → The "Aha!" Moment → Implementation Logic → Current Status (In-Flight/Pending).
- [ ] **Visual Logic Flow:** Add a diagram (Mermaid.js or high-res export) for the "Criticality-Aware Drop Control" logic. Visualizing how data is sampled/dropped based on context is a massive "Big Data" signal.

### 4. Big Data & AI Pivot Signals
**Goal:** Broaden appeal beyond the "Security" silo into general Data Engineering.
- [ ] **Reframe Telemetry as Data Engineering:** In your "About" or "Experience" section, use keywords like Data Orchestration, ETL/ELT Optimization, and High-Concurrency Processing.
- [ ] **AI-Workflow Prototypes:** Since you mention GitHub prototypes for "AI-assisted workflows," add a "Project Spotlight" that specifically details a tool you've built.
- [ ] **Hallucination Disclosure Note:** Clarify the "40% AI hallucination" note. Is it 40% of the code, the text, or the design? Frame it as a "Collaborative AI Workflow" experiment to show you are pioneering LLM integration into engineering tasks.

### 5. Content & SEO "Closers"
**Goal:** Increase external validation and "shareability."
- [ ] **"The Sieve" Series Call-to-Action:** At the end of your Math posts, add a section on how this type of algorithmic thinking applies to high-speed cybersecurity detections.
- [ ] **"War Stories" Section:** Add a "Lessons Learned" or "Retrospectives" section. High-level leaders are trusted more when they show how they handled a major failure or architectural pivot.
