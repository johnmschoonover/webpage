## Problem

Incident commanders relied on static exports and manual stitching across tools. The lack of time-synced telemetry slowed containment decisions and introduced data quality disputes.

## Approach

We created a streaming lakehouse backed by Iceberg and Druid, layered event correlation, and exposed domain-driven APIs. We also introduced a design system for dashboards to keep metrics consistent and auditable.

## Results

* Shifted command updates from 30-minute cycles to near real-time briefings.
* Raised data trust through lineage overlays and auto-generated annotations.
* Equipped executives with curated metrics to defend investments.

## Lessons Learned

Pair platform investments with enablement: champion notebooks, office hours, and reusable templates to accelerate adoption.
