## Problem

Our cloud security operations center relied on a patchwork of legacy collectors and bespoke parsers. Event delay regularly spiked past ten minutes during peak windows, obscuring live threat detection and forcing teams to work from stale dashboards.

## Approach

We designed a dual-vendor ingestion backbone with a Kafka layer to normalize payloads, hardened routing through Zero Trust gateways, and an adaptive schema registry. This enabled hot/hot distribution, automated parser testing, and policy-driven routing.

## Results

* Sustained < 90 second median ingestion delay during incident surges.
* Introduced runbooks and golden signals consumed by 12 partner teams.
* Exposed a feature flag system for content engineering to test parsers without impact.

## Lessons Learned

Invest early in test fixtures for every feed, and treat parser deployments as product releases with telemetry, rollback, and change review.
