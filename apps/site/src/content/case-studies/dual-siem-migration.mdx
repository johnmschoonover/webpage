## Problem

We needed to sunset a legacy SIEM that could not keep pace with ingestion growth, while the replacement platform required staged rollouts to validate parser parity and rule fidelity.

## Approach

Our team introduced a progressive delivery framework with synthetic data validation, blue/green connectors, and enforced runbook sign-off. Every use case shipped with an impact assessment and dashboards to verify parity during the dual-run.

## Results

* Retired 19 brittle ETL chains and replaced them with event streaming connectors.
* Rebuilt parser pipeline as versioned packages with semantic release.
* Enabled audit-ready traceability for every rule move.

## Lessons Learned

Treat migrations like products: instrument decisions, expose dashboards, and tell stakeholders what success looks like before cutover.
