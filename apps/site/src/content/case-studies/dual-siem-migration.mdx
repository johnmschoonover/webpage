## Problem

We needed to sunset a legacy SIEM that could not keep pace with ingestion growth, while new platforms required curated rollout patterns to validate parser parity, rule fidelity, and guard our security posture.

## Approach

Our team introduced a pattern library that blended progressive delivery with posture safeguards—synthetic data validation, blue/green connectors, and enforced runbook sign-off across every route. Each use case shipped with an impact assessment, dashboards to verify parity during the parallel runs, and instrumentation to track SLO/SLA lift alongside cost-to-serve.

## Results

* Retired 19 brittle ETL chains and replaced them with posture-aware event streaming connectors.
* Rebuilt parser pipeline as versioned packages with semantic release tied to multi-platform validation.
* Established continuous observability loops that lifted SLO/SLA benchmarks while reducing ongoing maintenance costs.
* Enabled audit-ready traceability for every rule move and migration pattern decision.

## Lessons Learned

Treat migrations like products: instrument decisions, expose dashboards, and define posture safeguards so stakeholders know the risk model before cutover.
