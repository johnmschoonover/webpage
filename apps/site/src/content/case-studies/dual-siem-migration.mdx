## Problem

The security organization relied on a mix of vendor-managed SIEMs whose divergent pipelines slowed expansion. Each new feed demanded bespoke ETL work, manual documentation, and coordination across tools, stretching delivery cycles to two weeks and driving up licensing and maintenance costs.

## Approach

We shifted from rules-first migration toward a cost-benefit program centered on automation. A templating engine generated end-to-end configurations—from ETL to datastore schemas, management APIs, and UI wiring—leaving only the unique parsing to customize. Every template emitted documentation and guardrails so platform patterns could be extended safely as coverage expanded.

## Results

* Offboarded the vendor SIEMs onto a unified platform while preserving posture and >99.9% uptime.
* Reduced feed-manipulation iterations from two weeks to about four hours at launch, then refined the tooling to deliver sub-hour—and often single-digit minute—cycles.
* Shifted engineering focus toward higher-value monitoring, alerting, and feed quality auditing.
* Introduced per-document visibility into failures and early-warning signals for platform issues.

## Lessons Learned

Investing in reusable ingestion templates pays down both cost and toil: once the scaffolding spans the entire stack, security teams can evolve faster without sacrificing reliability.
