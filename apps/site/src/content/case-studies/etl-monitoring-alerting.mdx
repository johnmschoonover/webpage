## Problem

Placeholder section that will explore the visibility gaps across ingestion, transformation, and indexing stages.

## Approach

Future copy will explain the monitoring architecture, alert thresholds, and automation that sustained signal quality.

## Results

When published, this section will track mean-time-to-detect, notification fidelity, and operator confidence lifts.

## Lessons Learned

Lessons learned will call out the governance and tooling principles that kept alerts actionable at scale.
